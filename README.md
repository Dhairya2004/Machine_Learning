<hr>

<p>Hey there, developers! This is a repository that contains implementation 
of different machine learning alogrithms and types. I have tried to implement 
it in various real life examples. 
</p>

<p>Would like to see more such examples from you!</p>
 
Run the following commands to get started
  
 ```
  git clone https://github.com/Suyog-23/LinearRegression.git
  ```
  ```
  cd LinearRegression
  ```
  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  <p>Run each cell in the jupyter notebook! And you are good to go!</p>
